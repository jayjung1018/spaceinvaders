#Space Invaders
The game Space Invaders made with Java Swing. A good opportunity to learn about OOP concepts and the Java Swing library as my first ever "real" Java project.

### To Run
Simply clone the repo onto your desktop and execute the JAR file within the folder.

### Instructions:
Press Start on the top of the game screen to start.

Use the arrow keys to move, space to fire.   
Each alien is worth different points. At 500 points, a UFO will appear. Shooting one of these grants a power up

Red = Rapid Fire  
Blue = Stop Time  
Yellow = Extra Life   

Killing all aliens will reset the game with harder aliens.
