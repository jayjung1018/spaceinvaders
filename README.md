#Space Invaders
My first ever Java project using OOP concepts.

### To Run
Simply clone the repo onto your desktop and execute the JAR file within the folder.

### Instructions:
Press Start on the top of the game screen to start

Use the arrow keys to move, space to fire
Each alien is worth different points. At 500 points, a UFO will appear. Shooting one of these grants a power up

Red = Rapid Fire
Blue = Stop Time
Yellow = Extra Life

Killing all aliens will reset the game with harder aliens.
